# 👋 Hi, I'm Lars G Stahl

### ⚖️ Founder of [AI Justice For All](https://github.com/aijusticeforall/ai-justice-for-all)

I'm building a vision that has lived in my heart for years: a non-human, morally intelligent AI system that can judge fairly, free from bias, ego, and corruption. A court of ethics, not politics.

> "We don't replace justice. We purify it."

### 🌍 Mission

To create an open-source AI court system that:
- Understands intent, trauma, and morality
- Judges fairly using truth and conscience
- Explains every verdict in plain human language
- Never serves profit or power — only justice
