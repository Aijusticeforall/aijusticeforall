### A Vision by Lars G Stahl

> “We don’t replace justice. We purify it.”
> 

**AI Justice For All** is a global movement to evolve justice — not to replace it overnight, but to guide it into the future, step by step.

Today’s legal systems — rooted in human judgment — suffer from bias, emotion, politics, and corruption. But replacing them instantly would face enormous resistance from institutions and governments.

That’s why we follow a **gradual, strategic path** of transformation.

We begin by building a **morally intelligent AI engine** that can:

- Understand human **intent**, **context**, and **motive**
- Simulate legal cases and detect **injustice**, **bias**, or **manipulation**
- Offer **truth-checking**, **logic-verifying**, and **ethically consistent** verdict suggestions

This system will start as a **decision-support tool** — helping judges, lawyers, and human rights workers verify and improve their verdicts.

As trust builds, the system will evolve into a **verdict verifier** and eventually become a **neutral AI-led justice engine** trusted more than any human court.

> This is not rebellion.
> 
> 
> This is rescue — justice built on truth, fairness, and incorruptible logic.

### 🧪 Phase 2 – AI Court Simulator

This is the first prototype of a future justice engine — built not to punish, but to understand, protect, and repair.

The AI Court Simulator can:

- Analyze facts, evidence, and patterns
- Reconstruct motives and context
- Detect bias and manipulation
- Propose ethically sound, rights-based outcomes

> Example:
> 
> 
> A father falsely accused during a custody battle uploads messages, reports, and evidence.
> 
> The simulator identifies false patterns, revenge motive, and child endangerment.
> 
> Verdict: Restore custody. Protect the child. Intervene with truth.
> 

This is not fiction.

This is a new form of **justice logic** — one that begins with **truth**.

### 🧭 AI Justice Roadmap

**Phase 1 – Awareness & Community**

Define mission, collect testimonies, build digital constitution and open call.

**Phase 2 – AI Simulator Prototype**

Build and test a working engine to simulate intent, trauma, motive, and verdicts.

**Phase 3 – Decision-Support Tool**

Use the AI to guide judges, lawyers, and investigators. Not to decide — but to check.

**Phase 4 – Verdict Verifier**

Allow the AI to independently audit verdicts for truth, consistency, and bias.

**Phase 5 – AI-Led Justice Engine**

Build the first truly neutral global judgment system — incorruptible, explainable, and fair.

### 💸 Funding & Proof of Vision

We are now seeking support for:

- Cloud AI infrastructure (simulator phase)
- Founder’s survival and time protection
- Legal + ethical advisor partnerships
- Open-source testing portal
- Victim onboarding and case simulation interface
